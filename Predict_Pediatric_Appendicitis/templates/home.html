          <h2>What is Appendicitis?</h2>
          <p>
            Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch that
            protrudes from the large intestine. It is considered a medical
            emergency that requires immediate attention, especially in children
            and young adults.
          </p>
          <h3>Causes of Appendicitis:</h3>
          <p>Appendicitis can be caused by various factors, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Blockage of the appendix due to stool, a foreign body, or cancer.
            </li>
            <li>Infection from a gastrointestinal virus or bacteria.</li>
            <li>Inflammation due to inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Key Attributes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Commonly occurs in children and young adults, although it can
              affect anyone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Symptoms include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea,
              vomiting, and fever.
            </li>
            <li>
              If untreated, it can lead to serious complications, such as a
              ruptured appendix or peritonitis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Understanding these attributes can help in early detection and
            prompt treatment, improving outcomes for patients.

          <ul class="symptom-list">
            <li>
              <span class="icon">&#x2714;</span> Abdominal pain (usually
              starting around the navel and moving to the lower right side)
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="icon">&#x2714;</span> Nausea or vomiting, often
              following the abdominal pain
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="icon">&#x2714;</span> Fever, often mild but can be
              higher in serious cases
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="icon">&#x2714;</span> Loss of appetite and inability
              to eat
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="icon">&#x2714;</span> Diarrhea or constipation,
              depending on the individual
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These symptoms may vary from person to person, and not all symptoms
            need to be present for appendicitis to be a concern.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seek
            medical attention immediately.

          <h2>Train Your AI Model</h2>
          <p>
            Ready to enhance the detection capabilities of our AI model?
            Training the model is crucial for improving its accuracy in
            predicting appendicitis based on symptoms and patient history.
          </p>
          <h3>Why Train the Model?</h3>
          <p>
            A well-trained model can help healthcare providers make better
            decisions and improve patient outcomes by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Incorporating a wider range of data for more accurate predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learning from historical cases to identify patterns and trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reducing the time to diagnosis, which is critical in emergencies.
            </li>
          </ul>
